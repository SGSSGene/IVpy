# Introduction

**IV2py** provides python bindings for [IVio](https://github.com/iv-project/IVio), [IVsigma](https://github.com/iv-project/IVSigma) and [fmindex-collection](https://github.com/SGSSGene/fmindex-collection).
The goal is to cover typical functionality for **bioinformatics** and have a playground on how python bindings for a successor of SeqAn3 and it's binding could look like.

## Support

 - **fasta** (rw) + **gzip** (rw)
 - **sam** (rw)
 - suffix array construction
 - fmindex based search
